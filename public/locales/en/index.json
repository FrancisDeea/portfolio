    "description": "Hello, I'm Francis, a passionate web developer. I love creating websites and applications with JavaScript, using React and Next as my favorite tools. I also master databases with MongoDB and Postgresql. I don't separate from my Linux terminal, where I use Git and Bash to manage my projects. I live in the beautiful city of Malaga, but I have no problem working with other time zones or languages, as I speak English quite well.",
